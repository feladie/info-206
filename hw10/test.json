Recently re-visited Thai Pan for a quick lunch and quickly ordered without spending too much time perusing the menu.  It looked more diverse than I remembered including some Vietnamese additions.  I remembered the curries and stir-fry dishes were ok but nothing really memorable.  A quick summary for my latest visit:\n\nPros:\n- convenient order-at-the counter setup\n- self-serve drink station\n- brown and white rice mixture\n- friendly and gracious owners\n\nCons:\n- too much napa cabbage in comparison to green vegetables \n- wish the owner/chef would be back in the kitchen vs. managing\n- spice level on the weak side", "type": "review", "business_id": "WIcDFpHEnC3ihNmS7-6-ZA"}

She understands my hair type and knows exactly what to do with my hair.  She keeps a record of my previous visits.  She recommends what is best for my hair.  She is pleasant to work with: easygoing, friendly, and respectful.  I've been going to her since 2008.  I'm really picky with hair people, and I used to go back to Chicago for haircuts.  Now, I stick to Marilo.", "type": "review", "business_id": "70p94Ejeu1v5XlIkbKORYQ"}
